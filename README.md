## A Split-Belt Instrumented Treadmill with Uneven Terrain

Supporting material

Engineering drawings and finite element analysis

The repository includes files generated in SolidWorks, such as SolidWorks parts (.SLDPRT), assemblies (.SLDASM), and drawings (\*.SLDDRW). The best practice is to download the entire folder (repository) to the same location to avoid upsetting dependencies. The two main files are SolidWorks assemblies for:

Original structure: Treadmill_Original

Modified structure: Treadmill_Modified

The drawings for the original structure are unofficial, and were not provided by Bertec Inc. They are our approximations for the unmodified structural elements, used only as a starting point for the modified structure. The treadmill was produced by Bertec in mid-2000s. There is currently a newer model with a slimmer profile, which would require updated drawings.

The modified structure describes the parts needed to increase the structural clearance for a mid-2000s treadmill.

The files enable you to access the associated components' 3D models (parts) and check the FEA analysis results. They also allow you to view the exploded view under the “Configuration Manager”. We performed 'Static,' 'Buckling,' and 'Natural Frequency' analyses. To retrieve the analysis results, you need to have "SOLIDWORKS Simulation" added in.
